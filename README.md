Awesome Batman.js Demo: Backed by Rails
=======================================

That's all it is: a demo app. I'll be presenting a remake of it at ATLRUG on June 12th at 6:30. Come on out for some chow, code, and brilliant discussion with people other than me!

Madness
-------

I have a confession: I love the bleeding edge. So you'll need Rails 4, Ruby 2.0.0, and edge Batman.js.

Contribute
----------

Eh, it's an example so contribs don't really make sense, but if something really bugs you, by all means!
