Awesome: Batman.js & Rails Demo
===============================

That's all it is: a demo app. I'll be presenting a remake of it at ATLRUG on June 12th at 6:30. [Come on out](http://meetu.ps/wJmb8) for some chow, code, and brilliant discussion with people other than me!

Madness
-------

I have a confession: I love the bleeding edge. So you'll need Rails 4, Ruby 2.0.0, and edge Batman.js. And Redis if you really want to.

Get it running
--------------

1. Clone the repo
2. Switch to Ruby 2.0.0
3. `bundle install`
4. `dance install` if you're too lazy to type `brew install redis`
5. `foreman start` in one terminal window
6. `rails server` in another
7. Open a browser (or two or three) to http://localhost:3000/posts

Contribute
----------

Eh, it's an example so contribs don't really make sense, but if something really bugs you, by all means!
